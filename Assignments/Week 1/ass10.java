		System.out.println("\nObject Oriented\nIn Java, everything is an Object. Java can be easily extended since it is based on the Object model.");
		System.out.println("\nPlatform Independent\nUnlike many other programming languages including C and C++, when Java is compiled, it is not compiled into platform specific machine, rather into platform-independent byte code. This byte code is distributed over the web and interpreted by the Virtual Machine (JVM) on whichever platform it is being run on.");
		System.out.println("\nSimple\nJava is designed to be easy to learn. If you understand the basic concept of OOP Java, it would be easy to master.");
		System.out.println("\nSecure\nWith Java's secure feature it enables to develop virus-free, tamper-free systems. Authentication techniques are based on public-key encryption.");
		System.out.println("\nArchitecture-neutral\nJava compiler generates an architecture-neutral object file format, which makes the compiled code executable on many processors, with the presence of Java runtime system.");
		System.out.println("\nPortable\nBeing architecture-neutral and having no implementation dependent aspects of the specification makes Java portable. The compiler in Java is written in ANSI C with a clean portability boundary, which is a POSIX subset.");
		System.out.println("\nRobust\nJava makes an effort to eliminate error-prone situations by emphasizing mainly on compile time error checking and runtime checking.");
		System.out.println("\nMultithreaded\nWith Java's multithreaded feature it is possible to write programs that can perform many tasks simultaneously. This design feature allows the developers to construct interactive applications that can run smoothly.");
		System.out.println("\nInterpreted\nJava byte code is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and is not stored anywhere. The development process is more rapid and analytical since the linking is an incremental and light-weight process.");
		System.out.println("\nDynamic\nJava is considered to be more dynamic than C or C++ since it is designed to adapt to an evolving environment. Java programs can carry an extensive amount of run-time information that can be used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run-time.");
